In terms of goals for the week, our main objective was to establish a basic structure for the project, distribute tasks among team members, and complete the first algorithm. And we accomplished all of these goals.

We split into two groups. One group was responsible for data reading and able to successfully extract the data from the dataset and store it in a graph. Another was working on the algorithm and finished the constructor of the graph structure. Overall, we made excellent progress this week. 

We did encounter some problems along the way. For example, we had some difficulty figuring out how to read the data from the dataset, and we also had to spend some time deciding on the best way to structure the graph to store the data. However, we were able to overcome these challenges in the end.

Moving forward, our plan for next week is to complete the remaining algorithms and ensure that everything is integrated smoothly with the different data structures.
